# Overview

Primitive, standardized, easy-to-draw diagrams to quickly communicate software _structure_ and _behavior_.

# Overview

## Types of diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) provides for many types of diagrams, divided into two categories:

| Structural          | Behavioral             |
| :------------------ | :--------------------- |
| Class diagrams      | Activity diagrams      |
| Package diagrams    | Sequence diagrams      |
| Object diagrams     | Use case diagrams      |
| Component diagrams  | State diagrams         |
| Deployment diagrams | Communication diagrams |
|                     | Interaction diagrams   |
|                     | Timing diagrams        |

# Overview

## Types of diagrams

We will explore just a few diagram types for example.

The book, "[The Elements of UML Style](http://bit.ly/se-elements-of-uml-style)", by Scott W. Ambler is a good reference for more - we have pulled many insights from it here.

name: best-practices

# Best Practices

---

# Best Practices

Regardless of which diagram type, following best practices keeps diagrams understandable and avoids common pitfalls.

- Avoid crossed lines
- Avoid diagonal and curved lines
- Use consistent sizes
- Flow from top-to-bottom, left-to-right

---

# Best Practices

## Avoid crossed lines

Don't do this:

name: classes

# Classes

---

# Classes

Used to display the attributes, methods, and interactions of object-oriented classes in code.

---

# Classes

A single class:

![UML class diagram](../images/uml_class_diagram.png)

---

# Classes

Relationships among classes, plus annotations, in a casual style:

![UML class diagram](../images/uml_class_diagram_relationship.png)

---

name: use-cases

# Use Cases

---

# Use Cases

Used to indicate interactions between actors and the system.

---

# Use Cases

A single actor, a single system:

![UML use case diagram](../images/uml_use_case_diagram.png)

---

# Use Cases

Multiple actors, multiple releases:

![UML use case diagram](../images/uml_use_case_diagram_complex.png)

---

name: activities

# Activities

---

# Activities

Flow charts often used to document a complex operation, the logic of one or more use cases, or any other process.

---

# Activities

![UML activity diagram](../images/uml_activity_diagram.png)

---

name: sequences

# Sequences

---

# Sequences

Used to validate and work out the logic and completeness of a certain scenario, often a use case or a part of a use case.

These show the entire sequence of messages sent among the objects and systems involved in the scenario.

---

# Sequences

![UML sequence diagram](../images/uml_sequence_diagram.png)

---

name: state-charts

# State Charts

---

# State Charts

Indicate the dynamic behavior of an entity based on its response to events, showing how the entity reacts to various events based on its current state.

- Only useful when behavior changes significantly based on internal state of the object.
