## Course description

We learn how to build software following contemporary best practices.

--

This course is as much about _process_ as it is about _product_.

--

Students work in teams to produce a software product of their choosing.

# Topics

---

template: topics

## Agile development

We will learn **agile development**'s origins.

--

- In what contexts are "agile" principles useful.

--

- What are its own unique challenges.

--

- In particular, we will follow the **Scrum framework** for agile development.

---

template: topics

## Javascript stack

We will dive head-first into the **Javascript stack** for web app development. In particular, the **MERN stack**.

--

- **M**ongoDB as the **database**

--

- **E**xpress.js for the **back-end**.

--

- **R**eact.js for the **front-end**

--

- **N**ode.js as our general Javascript programming environment.

--

You will absorb HTML, CSS, and Javascript through **osmosis**...

--
unless you're not paying attention.

---

template: topics

## We will learn through osmosis?

Yes.

--

- This is perhaps the biggest topic of the course... how to teach yourself what you don't know.

---

template: topics

## User experience design

You will have to figure out how to determine what makes a good experience versus a mediocre or terrible one.

---

template: topics

## Skills we will develop

You cannot do contemporary work without some fundamental skills.

--

- Basic UNIX/Linux commands

--

- Version control (i.e. `git` and `GitHub`)

--

- Automating the boring parts (i.e. `ssh`, unit testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment)

---

template: topics

## Questions we will answer

There are common questions we will aim to answer:

--

- What is The World Wide Web?

--

- How do you do _xyz_?

--

- I have an idea for an app... is it hard to do?

--

- Should I go to a start-up academy, or just study at NYU CS?

--

- My internship requires me to know _express-validator_.... what is that?

--

- My friend is making mad money at a start-up using MongoDB... can I learn that?

## Install these now

You will need a variety of software tools. Here are a few to set up right now.

--

- Git - [for Mac](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

--

- A UNIX-like shell, such as in Mac's **Terminal** or **Git Bash** (part of Git for Windows) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I do not recommend using any Windows shells.

--

- an account set up on [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

--

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

--

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

--

- [Discord](https://discord.com)

## Setting Up Bash within Visual Studio Code

WINDOWS USERS - you should use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) rather than Windows' default Powershell or other command line shell program. To set Git Bash or WSL as the default terminal shell within Visual Studio Code, you can try to follow the instructions in [the second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) by **Mahade Walid** and edited by **FruityOatyBar** (ignore the first answe, which is outdated).
