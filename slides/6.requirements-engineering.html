# Overview

# Overview

Requirements engineering is the disciplined process of defining what a project requires to be done and how it must be done.

# Motivations

---

# Motivations

Requirements provide several benefits to a project:

- Clearly defining the features and functionality that must be developed
- Defining the performance, security, and maintainaibility of the system
- Assisting in the cost and time estimates of the project
- Avoiding disputes by having all parties agree on what is to be done

# Types

---

# Types

There are two top-level categories of requirements:

- Functional
- Non-functional

---

# Types

## Functional requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do, in layman's terms, including:

- Services the system must provide to its users
- How the system must behave in particular situations
- What outputs the system must provide in response to particular inputs

---

# Types

## Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements specify constraints on either the system or the development process, including:

- Timing constraints
- Constraints on the development process
- Constraints on technologies that must or must not be used
- Standards that must be followed by the project
- Performance - e.g. speed, size, memory, uptime, reliability, load handling, portability

# User Requirements

---

# User Requirements

A type of functional requirement focused on the user experience.

Define what a user must be able to do with the system, written in layman's terms.

There are two popular ways of writing user requirements:

- **Use Cases**
- **User Stories**

---

# User Requirements

## Use Cases

Describe how an _actor_ achieves their _goals_ using the system.

A list of actions and events involved in a specific user interaction.

---

# User Requirements

## Use Cases

At a minimum contains:

- **Title** - a short phrases with an active verb describing the goal of the interaction
- **Actor** - the person or system who desires the goal
- **Scenario** - step-by-step description of how the goal is achieved by the actor

---

# User Requirements

## Use Cases

Example:

> Title: Purchase items
>
> Actor: Customer
>
> Scenario: Customer reviews items in shopping cart. Customer provides payment and shipping information. System validates payment information and responds with a confirmation of order and provides order number that Customer can use to check on order status. System will send Customer a confirmation of order details and tracking number in an email.

---

# User Requirements

## Use Cases

Written use cases often are accompanied by a Unified Modeling Diagram Language (UML) diagram:

---

# User Requirements

## User Stories

An alternative to Use Cases, written in user-centric language:

As a **, I want **, so I can \_\_.

- First blank is filled with the actor
- Second blank is filled with the goal
- Third blan is filled with the motivation

---

# User Requirements

## User Stories

Each User Story also includes:

- Estimated level of effort
- Acceptance criteria

---

# User Requirements

## User Stories

Example:

> As a customer, I want to sign up so I can start placing orders.
>
> Effort: M
>
> Acceptance criteria:
>
> 1. Customer name is captured and saved
> 2. Customer email is captured and saved
> 3. Customer phone number is captured and saved
> 4. Customer password is captured and saved
> 5. Invalid name, email, phone, and passwords are rejected
> 6. Customer is signed in automatically after registration

# Elicitation

---

# Elicitation

How do you gather requirements?

- Interviews
- Observatiion
- Intuition

---

# Elicitation

## Interviews

It would typically be a mistake not to interview:

- Key stakeholders
- A representative sample of end-users

---

# Elicitation

## Interviews

An interview can either be conducted in an _open_ or _closed_ manner.

- **Open interviews** - are open-ended discussions where the conversation meanders.
- **Closed interviews** - follow a prepared set of questions and topics for discussion.

---

# Elicitation

## Observation

Observing end-users achieving their goals without your system, such as with...

- an _alternative system_ or solution
- a _prototype_ of your intended system
- an _earlier version_ of your system

---

# Elicitation

## Observation

Similarly to interviews, observation can either be active or passive.

- **Scripted** - observer asks the user to perform certain tasks and then records how they complete it.
- **Unscripted** - the observer silentyly watchess the user performing their everyday tasks without interruption.

---

# Elicitation

## Intuition

Realistically, a requirements engineer (who may also be a software engineer) already has preeconceived notions of what users might want to do with the system based on their experience.
