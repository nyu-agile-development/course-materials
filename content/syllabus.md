# Syllabus

Agile Software Development & DevOps<br />
New York University<br />
Department of Computer Science

## Course description

Agile software development has come to describe a specific approach and toolset that allow for the requirements of a software project to change as a project progresses without disrupting schedules, budgets, and responsibilities. The field of DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, has introduced further processes and infrastructure to automate many of the tasks required in such development. Together, an Agile methodology and DevOps automation have increased the speed, robustness, and scalability with which software is developed today and have reduced the uncertainty of outcomes inherent in complex software development. Upon completion of this course, students will understand the core methodologies, technologies, and tools used in the software industry today.

## Prerequisites

Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA.0201) with a grade of C or better

## Learning objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be familiar with some of the most important software development tools and practices, including:

- Agile development / Scrum
- Version control / source code management
- Code collaboration / code review
- Web architecture
- Javascript / ECMAScript
- Mobile web application design
- Full-stack development
- User experience design
- Rapid prototyping
- Unit testing
- Database integration
- User authentication
- Deployment

To achieve mastery in these topics, students will take quizzes corresponding to the material covered in each lecture while also working with a single team on a single software project for the majority of the semester.

While significant class time is dedicated to hands-on student work, students are expected to collaborate with their teams for 5-10 hours each week reviewing instructional materials provided by the instructor and programming their software projects.

## Getting help

Help resources available to you are listed in order of urgency of your problem:

### Messaging

Our course will use a message board (link to be distributed in class) as its main communication channel for announcements and discussion. This is a good place to ask questions that anyone - other students, graders, tutors, or the professor - can answer. This is a resource best used when the answer is not required urgently.

### Tutoring

Tutors for this course are waiting to answer your questions, either on our message board or during dedicated tutoring hours. Use tutoring for more involved questions and when you prefer a more immeidate answer.

Tutoring hours (all times in Eastern Time):

- TBD

### Talk with the instructor

For any issues at all, contact the instructor:

- see me before class
- raise your hand or simply speak during class
- see me after class
- come to my open office hours - hours to be distrubuted in class

### Additional tutoring resources

Additional academic support is also available through the [University Learning Center](http://www.nyu.edu/ulc).

## Attendance & participation

Attendance is mandatory. In-class and online message board participation is encouraged. Students who do not attend class regularly and who do not participate in discussions tend to do poorly.

## Required software and hardware

All students require access to a computer on which they can write software using a specific set of applications. Computers at any of the university's computer labs will do, as will any laptop or desktop computer.

### i6 account

In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a special computer account on a Unix web server named [i6.cims.nyu.edu](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu) which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an [i6 account](http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6) and we will use it to host our websites.

- Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on [this FAQ page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq).
- If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to [this page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword) for instructions on how to do so.
- If you do not receive notification that an account has been created for you, check your spam, and try to reset your password using the link above.

### Computer labs

Macintosh computers with all of the necessary software installed are available to you in the [ITS labs](http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/). You do not need your own computer nor do you need to purchase any software. However, you will be learning how to use various programs and may wish to have access to them at home or on your laptop. In this case, you must purchase your own license or use a trial version, which is sometimes available from the publisher. You can download software provided by ITS to all students, including SFTP programs, by going to the [ITS software page](https://www.nyu.edu/its/software/).

The main computer lab to use for this class is the [LaGuardia Co-op](http://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/locations-and-facilities/student-technology-centers/laguardia-co-op.html), located at 541 LaGuardia Place. There are [other labs](http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/) on campus, but this is also where tutors will be available to meet with you.

#### Saving your work in the lab

You will be able to save your work in the ITS labs on your own flash drive, or online cloud storage services such as [Box.com](https://nyu.box.com) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com). Although you can write to the storage drives of the machines in the labs, you cannot be sure that you will have access to the same machine the next time you enter the lab and the drives in the lab are frequently erased.

## Grading

You will receive a grade calculated mechanically on the following rubric.

- 35%: Quizzes
- 15%: Individual exercises
- 50%: Team project

### Quizzes

Quizzes are completed outside of class. You must be logged into Google with your NYU Net ID account in Google in order to view the Quizzes. If you see an error message indicating you do not have permission to view a Quiz, it is because you are not logged into the correct NYU Net ID account.

Quizzes are submitted by submitting a Google Form.

### Team projects

The main project is to design and build a mobile web application using an industry-standard Javascript-based technology stack. While some class sessions are dedicated to working on projects, the majority of the development time will occur outside of class.

Projects are submitted by using [git](https://git-scm.com/) to upload code to [GitHub](https://github.com).

- we will cover how to push code to GitHub
- unless you have good reason to do otherwise, follow best-practices for all [basic file names and file extensions](https://knowledge.kitchen/Basic_computer_concepts#File_names)

Team projects are broken up into 5 "sprints" - iterations of work - each of which is approximately 2 weeks long. Students will receive a grade for each sprint based on the following:

- their personal contribution to the project (judged by lines of code added, lines of code deleted, number of "commits", number of "merges" - we will cover these terms)
- the overall quality of the work the team has produced
- the fidelity of the team's adherence to the agile development workflow prescribed in the course

### Late policy

All assigned work is due _before_ class on the due date indicated on the [schedule](/)

- for every 24 hours that work is late, we apply a 10% penalty on the grade, up to a maximum penalty of 30%.
- after 72 hours, we will no longer accept the work.
- for group work, each member of the group will be penalized individually.

### Extensions

Students are automatically granted 2 late assignment extensions of up to 3 days late each, with the exception that all assignments must be submitted before the last day of regular classes before the final exam period.

- when submitting an assignment for which you would like to use one of these automatic extensions, you must notify the grader that you are using the extension, otherwise your assignment will be rejected.
- for group work, each member of the group must use an extension (or lose points if none is available) for the entire group to submit work late.
- _No additional extensions will be granted._

### Regrade requests

If a student requests a regrade of any work, we will regrade the work in full, not just the part that the student believes has been mis-graded.

## Academic Integrity

Working with others and leveraging all resources available to you is a prerequisite for success. This is different from copying, cheating, plagiarism, and mental laziness. All submitted work must be your own. There are very reliable systems we use to detect plagiarism in computer code, such as [moss](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) and [compare50](https://github.com/cs50/compare50). If you submit any work that is not your own, you risk failure or worse.

Please read the [Computer Science department's policy on academic integrity](http://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) and the [University-wide policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) which supercedes it.
